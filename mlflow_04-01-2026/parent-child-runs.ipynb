    "# Leveraging Child Runs in MLflow for Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of machine learning, the task of hyperparameter tuning is central to model optimization. This process involves performing multiple runs with varying parameters to identify the most effective combination, ultimately enhancing model performance. However, this can lead to a large volume of runs, making it challenging to track, organize, and compare these experiments effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MLflow** incorporates the ability to simplify the large-data-volume issue by offering a structured approach to manage this complexity. In this notebook, we will explore the concept of **Parent and Child Runs** in MLflow, a feature that provides a hierarchical structure to organize runs. This hierarchy allows us to bundle a set of runs under a parent run, making it much more manageable and intuitive to analyze and compare the results of different hyperparameter combinations. This structure proves to be especially beneficial in understanding and visualizing the outcomes of hyperparameter tuning processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we will:\n",
    "- Understand the usage and benefits of parent and child runs in MLflow.\n",
    "- Walk through a practical example demonstrating the organization of runs without and with child runs.\n",
    "- Observe how child runs aid in effectively tracking and comparing the results of different parameter combinations.\n",
    "- Demonstrate a further refinement by having the parent run maintain the state of the best conditions from child run iterations."

    "### Starting Without Child Runs\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the structured world of parent and child runs, let's begin by observing the scenario without utilizing child runs in MLflow. In this section, we perform multiple runs with different parameters and metrics without associating them as child runs of a parent run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the code executing five hyperparameter tuning runs. These runs are not organized as child runs, and hence, each run is treated as an independent entity in MLflow. We will observe the challenges this approach poses in tracking and comparing runs, setting the stage for the introduction of child runs in the subsequent sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the above code, you can proceed to the MLflow UI to view the logged runs. Observing the organization (or lack thereof) of these runs will help in appreciating the structured approach offered by using child runs, which we will explore in the next sections of this notebook.\n"

The child runs are neatly nested under a parent run, providing a clear, hierarchical view of all the runs, making it exceptionally convenient to analyze and compare the outcomes.\n",

    "- **Structured View:** The child runs, grouped under a parent run, offer a clean and structured view in the MLflow UI.\n",

    "- **Distinct Naming:** Utilizing visually distinct naming for runs aids in effortless identification and selection within the UI.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this phase, we focus on **refining the hyperparameter search space**. This is a crucial step in the hyperparameter tuning process. After a broad exploration of the parameter space, we are now narrowing down our search to a subset of parameter values. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Caution\n",
    "While this approach is a common tactic in hyperparameter tuning, it's crucial to acknowledge the implications. Comparing results from the narrowed search space directly with those from the original, broader search space can be misleading. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Is It Invalid to Compare?\n",
    "- **Nature of Bayesian Tuning Algorithms:** Bayesian optimization and other tuning algorithms often depend on the exploration of a broad parameter space to make informed decisions. Restricting the parameter space can influence the behavior of these algorithms, leading to biased or suboptimal results.\n",
    "- **Interaction of Hyperparameter Selection Values:** Different parameter values have different interactions and impacts on the model performance. A narrowed search space may miss out on capturing these interactions, leading to incomplete or skewed insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while refining the search space is essential for efficient and effective hyperparameter tuning, it's imperative to approach the comparison of results with caution, acknowledging the intricacies and potential biases involved.\n"

    "### Challenge: Logging Best Metrics and Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world of machine learning, it is crucial to keep track of the best performing models and their corresponding parameters for easy comparison and reproduction. **Your challenge is to enhance the `execute_tuning` function to log the best metrics and parameters from the child runs in each parent run.** This way, you can easily compare the best-performing models across different parent runs within the MLflow UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the `execute_tuning` function such that for each parent run, it logs the best (minimum) `metric1` found among all its child runs.\n",
    "2. Alongside the best `metric1`, also log the parameters `param1` and `param2` that yielded this best `metric1`.\n",
    "3. Ensure that the `execute_tuning` function can accept a `num_child_runs` parameter to specify how many child iterations to perform per parent run.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common practice that allows you to keep your MLflow experiments organized and easily retrievable, making the model selection process smoother and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
