Neural networks can learn complex patterns
Core building blocks — Neurons, weights, biases, and activation functions
Layers — How neurons are organized into input, hidden, and output layers
Forward propagation — How data flows through the network
Loss functions — How we measure prediction quality
Backpropagation — How networks learn by computing gradients
Optimization algorithms — How weights get updated (Adam, SGD, etc.)
Network architectures — Feedforward, CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers
Overfitting and regularization — How to build models that generalize
Training pipeline — The complete process from data to trained model
